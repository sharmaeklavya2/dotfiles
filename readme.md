# dotfiles

Tested on Ubuntu 16.04.

Running `scripts/make_links.py` will create symbolic links to my dotfiles
in a directory `_links`. Copy them and paste them in your home directory.

Running `scripts/get_vim_packages.py` will create a `.vim/bundle` directory
and clone all repositories mentioned in `vimpackages.txt`.
Make a symlink of the `.vim` directory and place it in your home directory.
